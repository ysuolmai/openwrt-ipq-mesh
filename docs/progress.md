# OpenWrt Mesh AC Progress

Last updated: 2026-06-13
Repository: https://github.com/ysuolmai/openwrt-ipq-mesh
Branch: `main`
Latest pushed commit before MTK work: `ba7ea05 Fix config validation for device BDF packages`

## Goal

Build an OpenWrt / ImmortalWrt based mesh system using an AC + managed AP model similar to commercial AC/AP systems. The initial platform was IPQ60XX; MT7981 support is being added through a separate workflow.

Current product direction:

- AC provides LuCI management UI and global mesh configuration.
- AP firmware runs an agent and registers to AC after it is connected to the AC LAN.
- AC approves APs and pushes Wi-Fi/backhaul/roaming config.
- AP keeps last config and should continue working if AC is offline.
- First pairing is intended to happen over Ethernet.
- After pairing, AP can use wireless 802.11s backhaul.
- When Ethernet is plugged in again, the intended behavior is wired backhaul first and wireless as fallback.

This replaced the earlier fully decentralized idea. DAWN is still used, but as a roaming/client steering component rather than the main control plane.

## Current Architecture

```text
Main router / AC
    |
    | Ethernet LAN, pairing and preferred backhaul
    |
Managed AP 1  )) 802.11s wireless backhaul ))  Managed AP 2
    |
2.4 GHz / 5 GHz client Wi-Fi SSID
```

Important design decision:

- AC can be the DHCP/NAT gateway, but it does not have to be.
- AP nodes should not default to DHCP/NAT/gateway behavior.
- AP nodes are intended to work as dumb managed APs.
- AC can also be a local mesh member when the AC hardware has Wi-Fi.
- AC local mesh member mode must preserve AC LAN/WAN/DHCP/firewall settings.

## Implemented Packages

### `mesh-ac`

Path: `package/mesh-ac/`

Provides:

- `/etc/config/mesh_ac`
- `/etc/init.d/mesh-ac`
- `/www/cgi-bin/mesh-ac`
- `/usr/sbin/mesh-ac-approve`
- `/usr/sbin/mesh-ac-list`
- `/usr/sbin/mesh-ac-apply-local`

Current behavior:

- Stores global SSID, mesh backhaul, KVR and DAWN settings.
- Receives AP registration through CGI endpoint `/cgi-bin/mesh-ac/register`.
- Stores one JSON file per AP under `/etc/mesh-ac/nodes/`.
- APs are unapproved by default.
- `mesh-ac-approve <node-id>` marks AP as approved.
- Approved APs can fetch rendered config through `/cgi-bin/mesh-ac/config`.
- `mesh-ac-apply-local` renders local AC config to JSON and calls `mesh-agent-apply --preserve-lan`.
- AC image config selects `mesh-agent` so the shared apply helper is present, while avoiding a package-level dependency cycle.

Security status:

- Home-use pairing is tokenless: `pairing_enabled=1` allows new AP registration, while approved APs can continue to fetch config after pairing is disabled.
- Future improvement can add a timed pairing window or per-AP credentials if stronger security is needed.

### `mesh-agent`

Path: `package/mesh-agent/`

Provides:

- `/etc/config/mesh_agent`
- `/etc/init.d/mesh-agent`
- `/usr/sbin/mesh-agent`
- `/usr/sbin/mesh-agent-apply`

Current behavior:

- Registers to configured AC URL.
- Default AC URL is `http://192.168.50.1/cgi-bin/mesh-ac`.
- Pulls AC config after approval.
- Applies OpenWrt UCI settings for:
  - 2.4 GHz / 5 GHz client AP SSID
  - 802.11k/v/r
  - 802.11s mesh backhaul
  - `batman-adv`
  - DAWN
- Supports `--preserve-lan` for AC local mesh member mode.
- The normal `mesh-agent` procd service is disabled on AC images when `/etc/config/mesh_ac` exists.

Known limitation:

- AC auto-discovery now uses mDNS with gateway/default fallback (see "AC discovery" below).
- AP can still pin a specific AC by setting `mesh_agent.main.ac_url`.

### `luci-app-mesh-ac`

Path: `package/luci-app-mesh-ac/`

Provides LuCI page:

```text
Services -> Mesh AC
```

Current UI:

- AC enable flag
- pairing enable flag
- AC local mesh member flag
- local apply button
- client SSID/password
- country
- mobility domain
- 802.11k/v/r flags
- mesh ID/key
- backhaul band/channel/mode
- DAWN options
- managed AP table
- approve button

## Build Targets

Current configs:

```text
configs/IPQ60XX-MESH-AC.txt
configs/IPQ60XX-MESH-AP.txt
configs/MT7981-MESH-AC.txt
configs/MT7981-MESH-AP.txt
```

Current supported IPQ60XX device entries:

```text
redmi_ax5
redmi_ax5-jdcloud
jdcloud_re-ss-01
qihoo_360v6
zn_m2
```

`zn_m2` is supported through the VIKINGYFY/immortalwrt fork profile and `ipq-wifi-zn_m2` package.

Current MT7981 device whitelist follows upstream `OpenWRT-CI/Scripts/diy.sh`:

```text
sx_7981r128
nokia_ea0326gmp
cmcc_rax3000m
```

`nokia_ea0326gmp` and `cmcc_rax3000m` are source profiles in `VIKINGYFY/immortalwrt` `owrt`. `sx_7981r128` is injected during `scripts/prepare-openwrt.sh`, using the upstream DTS/profile mechanism from OpenWRT-CI.

## GitHub Actions

Workflows:

```text
.github/workflows/build.yml
.github/workflows/build-mtk.yml
.github/workflows/clean.yml
```

Current behavior:

- Manual `workflow_dispatch` only.
- `Build IPQ Mesh` runs both IPQ AC and AP builds using matrix:
  - `IPQ60XX-MESH-AC`
  - `IPQ60XX-MESH-AP`
- `Build MTK Mesh` runs both MT7981 AC and AP builds using matrix:
  - `MT7981-MESH-AC`
  - `MT7981-MESH-AP`
- Inputs:
  - `source_repo`
  - `source_branch` (`main` for IPQ, `owrt` for MTK)
  - `test_config_only`
- Default source repo is `https://github.com/VIKINGYFY/immortalwrt.git`.
- AC images clone `ysuolmai/luci-theme-shadcn` during prepare and select `CONFIG_PACKAGE_luci-theme-shadcn=y`; AP images remain LuCI-less.
- Build cache is enabled for non-config-only runs, following upstream OpenWRT-CI: `.ccache`, `staging_dir/host*`, and `staging_dir/tool*` are cached and toolchain stamp files are refreshed after restore.
- `config_name` manual selection was removed.
- After `make defconfig`, workflow runs `scripts/check-openwrt-config.sh` to verify required device profiles, Wi-Fi driver/firmware symbols, source-side support files, KVR-capable `wpad-openssl`, DAWN, uMDNS, `batman-adv`, and the shadcn LuCI theme on AC images.
- Full firmware release collection follows the upstream OpenWRT-CI packaging style by collecting files from `bin/targets` while pruning package repositories. This keeps IPQ NAND factory outputs such as Redmi AX5 and ZN M2 `factory.ubi` without relying on a filename-extension whitelist.
- `Clean Artifacts` deletes completed workflow runs, deletes config-only releases, and keeps only the latest full firmware release per config target.

Validation already done:

- Matrix workflow was triggered with `test_config_only=true`.
- Both AC and AP jobs passed through `make defconfig`.
- This confirms package injection and config selection work at defconfig level.

Recent successful config-only releases:

```text
IPQ60XX-MESH-AC-ea53cef-9
IPQ60XX-MESH-AP-ea53cef-9
```

Recent successful config-only workflow run:

```text
https://github.com/ysuolmai/openwrt-ipq-mesh/actions/runs/27468404699
```

Full firmware build has not yet been run after the latest changes.

## Recently Implemented: AC Local Member

User asked whether the AC itself can also be a mesh member if the AC hardware has Wi-Fi.

Implemented design:

- `/etc/config/mesh_ac` has `option local_member '1'`.
- LuCI has `Enable AC local mesh member` and `Apply local mesh config` controls.
- `/usr/sbin/mesh-ac-apply-local` renders AC config into the same JSON structure used by managed APs.
- It calls `/usr/sbin/mesh-agent-apply --preserve-lan /tmp/mesh-ac-local-config.json`.
- `mesh-agent-apply --preserve-lan` applies Wi-Fi APs, 802.11s backhaul, `batman-adv`, and DAWN while preserving AC LAN/WAN/DHCP/firewall behavior. It removes existing LAN AP Wi-Fi interfaces such as the default `ImmortalWrt` SSID so the AC only advertises the configured mesh client SSID.
- Normal managed AP agent service is disabled on AC images so AC does not register to itself as a normal AP.
- Local apply is explicit through LuCI or `/usr/sbin/mesh-ac-apply-local`; first boot does not broadcast placeholder Wi-Fi credentials automatically.

Important safety rule:

```text
AC local member mode must not rewrite network.lan.proto, network.lan.ipaddr, network.wan, firewall zones, or DHCP server settings.
```

Validation done locally:

```sh
bash -n package/mesh-agent/files/usr/sbin/mesh-agent-apply
bash -n package/mesh-ac/files/usr/sbin/mesh-ac-apply-local
bash -n package/mesh-agent/files/etc/init.d/mesh-agent
bash -n package/mesh-agent/files/etc/uci-defaults/90-mesh-agent-enable
bash -n package/mesh-ac/files/etc/uci-defaults/90-mesh-ac-enable
bash -n scripts/check-openwrt-config.sh
git diff --check
```

## Current MTK Work

Implemented locally for MT7981 support:

- Added `configs/MT7981-MESH-AC.txt` and `configs/MT7981-MESH-AP.txt`.
- Added `.github/workflows/build-mtk.yml` with default source branch `owrt`, matching upstream `MTK-ALL.yml`.
- Added MTK whitelist filtering in `scripts/prepare-openwrt.sh`: `sx_7981r128`, `nokia_ea0326gmp`, `cmcc_rax3000m`.
- Added `target/mediatek/dts/mt7981b-sx-7981r128.dts`.
- Added SX 7981R128 injection into `target/linux/mediatek/image/filogic.mk`, `board.d/02_network`, and a first-boot uci-defaults script.
- Updated `scripts/check-openwrt-config.sh` with separate IPQ and MTK validation paths.

Validation still needed after push:

```sh
gh workflow run build-mtk.yml -R ysuolmai/openwrt-ipq-mesh -f test_config_only=true
```

## Important Known Issues / TODO

### 1. Wired-first / wireless-fallback (deferred — needs hardif redesign)

Current state: both backhauls coexist. The wireless 802.11s link is a
batman-adv hardif (`batmesh` -> `bat0`), `bat0` is bridged into `br-lan`, and
the Ethernet backhaul port is also a `br-lan` member. Loops are handled by
batman-adv `bridge_loop_avoidance` (`bat0.bridge_loop_avoidance=1`). There is no
explicit wired preference yet — the active path is whatever BLA elects.

A previous attempt added a watchdog that detached the wireless mesh from
batman-adv (`batctl if del`) whenever a wire was up and no mesh peer was
present. It was removed because it is both harmful and pointless:

- A wired AP whose downstream wireless AP goes offline drops its mesh peer
  count to zero and detaches its wireless backhaul. When the downstream AP
  returns it cannot re-peer (the detached mesh netdev stops beaconing on many
  drivers), and the wired AP only re-attaches after it sees the peer — a
  deadlock. This is the classic commercial-mesh "B can't rejoin after a
  reboot" failure.
- The only case where it actually detaches (one wired AP, zero mesh peers) is
  precisely the case with no loop to avoid. In the real loop case (two wired
  APs that also mesh wirelessly) it sees a peer and does nothing.

Correct fix (future, must be validated on hardware): make the Ethernet
backhaul a batman-adv hardif too (instead of bridging eth directly into
br-lan), and bias batman toward wired with `hop_penalty` on the wireless
hardif. Then batman natively prefers wired, and node leave/rejoin is handled by
batman without any external watchdog or deadlock.

### 2. AC discovery via mDNS (implemented)

AP agents resolve the AC through `ac_discovery` mode (`auto` by default):

1. explicit `mesh_agent.main.ac_url` if set and reachable
2. mDNS service `_mesh-ac._tcp` advertised by the AC (umdns)
3. default-gateway probe (AC acting as router)
4. last known good URL (cached at `/etc/mesh-agent/ac_url`)
5. hardcoded `192.168.50.1` as final fallback

Each candidate is validated by probing the AC root endpoint for
`{"service":"mesh-ac"}` before use, and the resolved AC is reused until it
becomes unreachable. AC side advertises through `/etc/umdns/mesh-ac.json` and
enables `umdns` in its uci-defaults.

Possible later improvement:

- DHCP option based hint
- QR/token based onboarding

### 3. Pairing security is intentionally simple

For home use, AP onboarding no longer uses a shared token. New APs can register only while `pairing_enabled` is on. Approved APs can keep pulling config after pairing is turned off.

Future, if stronger onboarding is needed:

- timed pairing window
- per-node key
- certificate or signed token
- reject unknown AP after pairing window closes

### 4. Full firmware compile not verified

Only `test_config_only=true` was validated before AC-local member and required-package checks.

Next config-only workflow should be run after pushing current changes, including both IPQ and MTK if possible. Full build should be run manually because it consumes more GitHub Actions time.

## Useful Commands

Check local repo:

```sh
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --decorate -5
```

Run config-only workflow:

```sh
gh workflow run build.yml -R ysuolmai/openwrt-ipq-mesh -f test_config_only=true
gh workflow run build-mtk.yml -R ysuolmai/openwrt-ipq-mesh -f test_config_only=true
```

Watch a run:

```sh
gh run watch <run-id> -R ysuolmai/openwrt-ipq-mesh --exit-status
```

List releases:

```sh
gh release list -R ysuolmai/openwrt-ipq-mesh --limit 8
```

## Handoff Notes

Remote `main` contains the stable AC/AP scaffold, AC-local member support, IPQ config validation, and after this work should contain MT7981 workflow/config support. MTK full firmware builds still need real CI and hardware validation.
